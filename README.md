## Instructions

You need to create a user account in order to use this website. (Currently there is no Email verification.)

Once you are logged in you will see all the predictions you made that are unresolved. You can create new ones, update your existing ones or delete them.

You can click on expired predictions to see all your resolved predictions.

You can evaluate all your resolved predictions by clicking Calibrate. (You need at least 10 resolved predictions.)
You can make a trace request or see your previously requested evaluations. 
You will receive the Posterior Predictive of the Bayesian Logistic Model made by Jan Christian Refsgaard.
The black line is the perfect predictor, the blue line shows your position.



## JSON Upload format
The entire Upload has to be encased with square brackets.
