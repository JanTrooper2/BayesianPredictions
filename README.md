## Steps to Work on:
### Priority High
- allow a button for callibration 2018, 2019, 2020, all, so create buttoms based on each year where predictions exists => change year by year
- create bulk up and download, so download all predictions as a csv/tsv and potentially upload them... I personally would prefere to write my predictions in vim and then upload a file :D... but I may be the odd exception

### Priority Medium

### Priority Low
- make it so that the user lands on a page rather than waiting for the trace request
