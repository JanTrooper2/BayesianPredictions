## Steps to Work on:
### Priority High
- Implement requests based on user predicionts

### Priority Medium
- Resize profile pictures

### Priority Low
- make it so that the user lands on a page rather than waiting for the trace request
- User needs to be logged in to do anything (maybe also check whether a user has access to a certain route)
