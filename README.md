# Welcome to Bayesian Predictions!
This Website was created for the purpose of evaluating the accuracy of your predictions to align yourself closer with reality.


## Instructions

You need to create a user account in order to use this website. (Currently there is no Email verification.)

Once you are logged in you will see all the predictions you made that are unresolved. You can create new ones, update your existing ones or delete them.

You can click on expired predictions to see all your resolved predictions.

You can evaluate all your resolved predictions by clicking Calibrate. (You need at least 10 resolved predictions.)
You can make a trace request or see your previously requested evaluations. 
You will receive the Posterior Predictive of the Bayesian Logistic Model made by Jan Christian Refsgaard.
The black line is the perfect predictor, the blue line shows your position.







## Steps to Work on:
### Priority High
- allow a button for callibration 2018, 2019, 2020, all, so create buttoms based on each year where predictions exists => change year by year
- create bulk up and download, so download all predictions as a csv/tsv and potentially upload them... I personally would prefere to write my predictions in vim and then upload a file :D... but I may be the odd exception

### Priority Medium

### Priority Low
- make it so that the user lands on a page rather than waiting for the trace request
